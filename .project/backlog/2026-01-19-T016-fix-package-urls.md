# Task: Fix package.json URLs (T016)

## Objective

Correct typo in package.json where repository/homepage/bugs URLs reference `aipm` instead of `aipim`.

**Success:**
- [ ] All URLs in package.json point to correct repository (`aipim`, not `aipm`)
- [ ] No references to old naming remain in package metadata

## Context

**Why:** Quality report identified naming inconsistency. Package points to wrong GitHub repository.

**Impact:** Users clicking on npm package links get 404 errors. Breaks "Report Issue" workflow.

**Related:** Code Quality Analysis Report 2026-01-19, ADR-004 (Standardize Naming)

## Implementation

### Single Phase (Est: 0.25h = 15min)
- [ ] Open package.json
- [ ] Find all URL fields (homepage, bugs.url, repository.url)
- [ ] Replace `aipm` with `aipim` in URLs
- [ ] Verify no other metadata references wrong name
- [ ] Commit change

## Definition of Done

### Functionality
- [ ] Works as specified
- [ ] All URLs resolve correctly (manual check on GitHub)
- [ ] npm package.json valid (no JSON errors)

### Testing
- [ ] Manual verification: click all URLs in package.json
- [ ] `pnpm install` still works
- [ ] No broken links

### Security
- [ ] N/A (metadata only)

### Code Quality
- [ ] JSON properly formatted
- [ ] No typos remain

### Documentation
- [ ] Time logged
- [ ] No ADR needed (trivial fix)
- [ ] README unchanged (uses correct name already)

### Git
- [ ] Atomic commit
- [ ] Convention: `fix(pkg): correct repository URLs from aipm to aipim`
- [ ] No conflicts

## Testing

### Manual
- [ ] Visit https://github.com/rmarsigli/aipim (should exist)
- [ ] Visit old URL https://github.com/rmarsigli/aipm (confirm it 404s or redirects)
- [ ] Check npm registry after publish (links correct)

## Blockers & Risks

**Current:**
- [ ] None

**Potential:**
1. Risk: Old name might be hardcoded elsewhere - Mitigation: Grep for `aipm` after fix

## Progress

### Time Log
| Date | Hours | Activity |
|------|-------|----------|
| | 0 | Not started |

**Total:** 0h / 0.25h

## Technical Notes

**Files to change:**
```json
// package.json
{
  "homepage": "https://github.com/rmarsigli/aipim",  // was aipm
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/rmarsigli/aipim/issues"  // was aipm
  },
  "repository": {
    "url": "https://github.com/rmarsigli/aipim"  // was aipm
  }
}
```

**Grep command to verify:**
```bash
grep -r "aipm" package.json README.md CHANGELOG.md
```
