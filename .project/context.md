# Current State

# Current State

# Current State

TASK-005 (Backlog Health) COMPLETED in 4h (4h estimated, 100% efficiency). Implemented weekly health check protocol (Fridays) and automated `backlog-health.sh` script to identify stale/blocked tasks. Updated installer to create archive directory.

# Active Work

**Status:** TASK-005 Completed. Ready for next task.

**Available backlog tasks:**
- TASK-003: ADR Automation (5h) - P2-M ⭐ Recommended next
- TASK-005: Backlog Health (4h) - P3

# Recent Decisions

**ADR-001 (2026-01-18):** Decided to use AIPIM for managing AIPIM development (dogfooding). Rationale: validates product, identifies gaps, builds credibility, creates authentic examples.

**Enhanced Agent Protocols:** Upgraded GEMINI.md/CLAUDE.md in DelphiChess project with automation protocols (error recovery, quality gates, smart task selection, session end). These protocols emerged from real-world usage and informed the enhancement backlog.

## Session 1.5 - Protocol Fix (2026-01-18, 30min)

**Bug Discovery:**
- User caught task duplication issue: TASK-004 existed in both backlog/ and completed/
- Root cause: Used `cp` instead of `mv` when starting task from backlog

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Removed TASK-004 from backlog (commit: e000dfa)
- ✅ Updated GEMINI.md/CLAUDE.md in DelphiChess with explicit `mv` workflow
- ✅ Updated AIPIM template with clarified commands
- ✅ Added warning: "Task should only exist in one place"

**Commits:**
- `chore: remove completed TASK-004 from backlog` (AIPIM)
- `docs: fix task workflow - use mv not cp for backlog tasks` (DelphiChess)
- `fix(templates): clarify mv vs cp for backlog tasks` (AIPIM template)

**Validation:**
- Dogfooding revealed real workflow issue
- Protocol now explicit about `mv` vs `cp`
- Won't repeat this mistake

**Time:** 30min

- **Phase Structure:** 3-5 phases of 2-6h each with deliverables
- **Validation:** Script checks phase count, estimates, deliverables, commit messages
- **Documentation:** Complete guide in basic-usage.md with before/after examples

**Technical Notes:**
- Validation script extracts phase estimates and sums them (±1h tolerance)

- Example provided: 18h User Profile task → 4 phases (3+6+5+4h)

**Validation:**
- Created 18h test task with proper breakdown
- Script correctly detected 4 phases, validated 18h sum
- All deliverables and commit messages verified

**Insights:**
- Session Starter is now the PRIMARY ENTRY POINT for AIPIM workflow
- Dogfooding validated: Used `aipim start` during this session!
- Quick Start Guide addresses all user confusion points
- Phase 1 & 2 implementation (a78db70) was already solid

**Time:** 2.5h (estimated: 4h, accuracy: 0.625 - 37.5% under!)

**Insights:**
- All 4 phases fit naturally in one implementation
- Resume + Start creates perfect session workflow
- Users now have 2-step entry: `aipim resume` → Y → coding
- Complements TASK-009 perfectly (they work together)
- Dogfooding proved value immediately

**Impact:**
- **Context restoration:** 5-15min → 10sec + review
- **Mental load:** Eliminated "what was I doing?" confusion
- **UX:** Now best-in-class for AI-assisted development
- **Workflow:** Simplest possible (1 command to resume work)

---

**Meta Notes:**
- This is the first context.md for AIPIM's own development
- Every entry here validates (or reveals gaps in) AIPIM's workflow
- Friction points become future enhancement tasks
- Success metric: If using AIPIM feels natural for AIPIM development, it's working
